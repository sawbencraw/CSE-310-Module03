# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continuously looking to expand my skills and deepen my understanding of various programming languages. To further my learning, I developed a text-based RPG (Role-Playing Game) in Java. This project demonstrates core concepts and features of the Java language, such as object-oriented programming, inheritance, interfaces, file I/O, and data structures from the Java Collection Framework.

The software is a simple yet engaging RPG game where the player controls a hero character, battling against multiple enemies through a series of encounters. The player can attack, use potions to heal, and employ special abilities to defeat enemies. The game also includes functionality to save and load game states, enhancing the user experience by allowing progress to be saved.

This project was a great opportunity to solidify my understanding of Java syntax and its object-oriented capabilities, as well as to practice implementing more complex features such as file I/O and the use of interfaces.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools and environments:

- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Libraries:** Java Standard Library (util, io)

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites to be particularly helpful:

- [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/)
- [GeeksforGeeks - Java Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

There are several areas for improvement and additional features that could be added to enhance the game:

- **More Complex Storyline:** Introduce a more detailed and engaging storyline with branching paths.
- **Additional Enemy Types:** Add more enemy types with unique abilities and strategies.
- **Improved UI:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more immersive experience.
- **Character Customization:** Allow players to customize their characters with different classes and skills.
- **Multiple Save Slots:** Implement multiple save slots to manage different game progressions.
